Our Reservation class has the method confirmReservation() which validates if a restaurant can accomodate a given reservation.
We need to build the conditional logic into confirmReservation() using three instance variables:
restaurantCapacity
guestCount
isRestaurantOpen
Use an if-then-else statement:
If restaurantCapacity is greater than or equal to guestCount and the restaurant is open, print "Reservation confirmed" and set isConfirmed to true.
else print "Reservation denied" and set isConfirmed to false.
Note: For now, the informUser() method will always print "Please enjoy your meal" even if the reservation was not confirmed. We will modify this method in an upcoming exercise!



public class Reservation {
  int guestCount;
  int restaurantCapacity;
  boolean isRestaurantOpen;
  boolean isConfirmed;
  
  public Reservation(int count, int capacity, boolean open) {
    guestCount = count;
		restaurantCapacity = capacity;
		isRestaurantOpen = open;
  }  
  
  public void confirmReservation() {
    /* 
       Write conditional
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
       if restaurantCapacity is greater
       or equal to guestCount
       AND
       the restaurant is open:
         print "Reservation confirmed"
         set isConfirmed to true
       else:
         print "Reservation denied"
         set isConfirmed to false
    */
    if (restaurantCapacity >= guestCount && isRestaurantOpen) {
      System.out.println("Reservation confirmed.");
      isConfirmed = true;
    } else {
      System.out.println("Reservation denied.");
      isConfirmed = false;
    }
  }
  
  public void informUser() {
    System.out.println("Please enjoy your meal!");
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Reservation partyOfThree = new Reservation(3, 12, true);
    Reservation partyOfFour = new Reservation(4, 3, true);
    partyOfThree.confirmReservation();
    partyOfThree.informUser();
    partyOfFour.confirmReservation();
    partyOfFour.informUser();
  }
}
